## FAQ
### What is this?
A project designed to display the arrivals status of a Corvallis bus stop.

### Why is it a mess of PHP?
At the time of creation, I had some old code that was easily adaptable to this need.
Additionally, I knew it would work well with OSU COE web hosting.

### I just tried to read the source and am questioning your sanity.
Yes, well this has been developed feature by feature as I think something else would be useful.
It functions reliably for what I need, but the code is pretty all over the place.

### This could look a lot better.
Probably. My aim was readability at a glance.

### How often does it update?
Ideally once every 30 seconds, then more frequently when an arrival is close.
